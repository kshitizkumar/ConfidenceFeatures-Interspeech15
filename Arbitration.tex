\begin{abstract}
Speech recognition confidence-scores quantitatively represent the correctness of
decoded utterances in a [0,1] range. Confidences are primarily used to accept recognitions
with scores greater than a threshold and thus contain recognitions from background noise
or out-of-grammar (OOG) speech. Confidence scores have also been used in other speech applications, 
(a) Rover where we do multi-system combination, (b) Arbitration where we pick one among multiple 
simultaneous recognitions, (c) selecting high quality data for unsupervised model training etc. 
Confidence-scores are computed from a rich set of confidence-features in the speech recognition engine. 
While many speech applications consume confidence scores, we haven't seen adequate focus on directly 
consuming confidence-features in applications. In this work we build a thesis that additionally consuming confidence-features can provide huge gains across confidence-related tasks and demonstrate that with respect to application to Arbitration, where we present 30\% relative reduction in arbitration metric. We also demonstrate an application of confidence-score in deep-neural-network (DNN) speaker adaptation metric, where we can double relative reduction in word-error-rate (WER) for DNN speaker adaptation on limited data.
