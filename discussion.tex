We demonstrated novel applications of confidence-features and confidence-scores in this work, where we presented strong gains for arbitration and DNN speaker adaptation. We also foresee an application of confidence-features to ROVER. Confidence-score is one of the strongest features for  ROVER system but these scores can be in different range across the individual systems, requiring an additional step of score normalization. We have noted that Confidence-features generalize across acoustic models and thus avoid requiring normalization. Confidence-scores are also used in model recommendation for different speakers, where we recommend one of the many AMs that may work best for particular speakers, there too we can leverage confidence-features. An approach to combine client and server ASR results while ensuring all client data remains private was recently presented in \cite{Nuance_Arbitration},  confidence-features may also be applicable to that task.
