We demonstrated novel applications of confidence-features and confidence-scores in this work, where we presented strong gains for arbitration and DNN speaker adaptation. We also foresee an application of confidence-features to in ROVER for system combination. Confidence-score is one of the strongest features for  ROVER system but these confidence-scores can be in different range across the individual systems, thus they required as additional step of normalizing the confidence-scores. We have noted that Confidence-features generalize across acoustic models and thus avoid the requirement of normalization step. Confidence-scores are also used in model recommendation for identical LM, where we recommend one of the many AMs that may work best in particular scenarios. There too we can leverage confidence-features for additional gain.
