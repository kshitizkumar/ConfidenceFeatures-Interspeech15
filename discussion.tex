We demonstrated novel applications of confidence-features and confidence-scores in this work, where we presented strong gains for arbitration and DNN speaker adaptation. We are also investigation applications of these confidence-features to speech applications in ROVER for system combination and for model recommendation for identical LM we can recommend one of the many AMs that may work best in particular scenarios. We are seeing promising gains in above applications.
